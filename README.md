# Smash Ultimate Analysis
An analysis of current trends in the competitive community for Super Smash Bros Ultimate. For now, this repo only consists of a single Jupyter notebook outlining a few main questions about the Smash dataset.
To take a look at my Medium article summarizing my findings, read on [here](https://medium.com/@gkap720/how-to-get-started-in-smash-a-data-driven-approach-999b2cf88ee3).
## The Data
I pulled the data from [this repo](https://github.com/smashdata/ThePlayerDatabase) and only looked at the data since the final balance was release in December 2021. This was so that I could examine only the current metagame and make sure my results were more relevant for players who are currently playing the game. A compressed version of the dataset is downloadable from this repo.
## Research Questions
The main questions I looked at were things that a new player of the game with very little knowledge of the metagame might ask. These include:
### Which character should I pick?
### Which stages should I pick?
### Are there any recent trends in character popularity?
## Results
To take a look at some of the results of this preliminary analysis, you can take a look at the notebook or you can read a more detailed explanation of those results in my blog post linked [here](https://medium.com/@gkap720/how-to-get-started-in-smash-a-data-driven-approach-999b2cf88ee3). There is no modeling done since the main questions to look at here are mainly explanatory rather than predictive.
